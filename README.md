# TuringMachine
A turing machine simulator written in java. The TM to be simulated is encoded into the TM.java file.
The tester class need not be modified.
To simulate an arbitrary turing machine, encode the instructions for the machine within the TM.java file into the transitionTable variable, according to the template described in the comments.
